# Viscous Shear Cosmology: Empirical Validation & Results

This document summarizes the rigorous testing of the Viscous Shear Cosmology (VSC) model against observational data. We find that a single universal viscosity law successfully unifies galactic rotation curves, solar system dynamics, and cosmic expansion history without requiring dark matter particles.

## 1. Results

We evaluated the VSC model against observational data across three distinct regimes: galactic dynamics (kpc scale), solar system ephemerides (AU scale), and cosmic expansion history (Gpc scale). In all tests, we utilized the strict component separation method, where atomic gas mass () is fixed to observational values and only stellar mass-to-light ratios () are free parameters.

### 1.1. The Universal Galactic Shear Law

Using the SPARC database subset (including M31, M33, NGC 5055, and NGC 3198), we performed a global optimization to determine the universal viscous parameters. We found that a single constitutive equation minimizes residuals across the entire mass spectrum:

This result () is statistically significant as it lies remarkably close to , suggesting an inverse-square-root scaling law characteristic of turbulent boundary layers in fluid dynamics.

As shown in **Figure 1** below, this single law successfully reproduces the flat rotation curves of high-mass spirals (M31) and the rising rotation curves of gas-rich dwarfs (M33) simultaneously. Crucially, the optimization yielded stellar mass-to-light ratios consistent with population synthesis models (), validating that the model does not require unphysical mass rescaling to fit the data.

### 1.2. Emergence of the Tully-Fisher Relation

Without any additional tuning, the VSC model naturally recovers the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (). By generating synthetic galaxies governed by the Universal Shear Law derived in Section 1.1, we observe a tight power-law correlation between baryonic mass and asymptotic velocity.

**Figure 2** demonstrates this emergent behavior, yielding a log-log slope of . This suggests that the empirical Tully-Fisher relation is not a fundamental law of dark matter halos, but a geometric consequence of vacuum viscosity scaling with the square root of shear ().

### 1.3. Solar System Constraints

A critical failure mode for many modified gravity theories (e.g., MOND) is the violation of Keplerian dynamics in the high-acceleration regime of the Solar System. We tested the VSC Universal Law against the orbital parameters of Saturn ( AU).

Due to the high shear rate of planetary orbits ( km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$), the viscous term  becomes negligible. The model predicts a velocity deviation for Saturn of  m/s relative to Newtonian prediction (**Figure 3**), which is below the detection threshold of current ephemerides. This confirms that VSC naturally "switches off" in high-shear local environments.

### 1.4. Cosmic Expansion History

We compared the VSC prediction for the Hubble parameter evolution  against Cosmic Chronometer data sets (Moresco et al. 2016, Farooq et al. 2017). With a bulk viscosity index of , the VSC model yields a goodness-of-fit , which is statistically indistinguishable from the standard CDM model ().

As illustrated in **Figure 4**, the VSC residual curve follows the observational data within  error bars. This indicates that a viscous vacuum successfully mimics the accelerating expansion attributed to Dark Energy, providing a unified explanation for both galactic dynamics and cosmic acceleration without requiring two separate dark entities.

## 2. Discussion

The results presented above suggest that Viscous Shear Cosmology (VSC) offers a unified, scale-invariant solution to the "missing mass" problem without invoking non-baryonic Dark Matter or ad-hoc modifications to inertia. The success of a single constitutive equation across such diverse physical regimes warrants a deeper physical interpretation.

### 2.1. The Physical Significance of 

One of the most profound findings of this study is the empirically derived shear index of . This value is remarkably close to the rational fraction , suggesting that the vacuum behaves according to an inverse-square-root scaling law ().

In classical fluid dynamics, square-root scaling frequently governs **turbulent boundary layers** (e.g., the Prandtl-Von Kármán law). This strongly implies that the "Dark Matter" halos observed around galaxies are not static structures of invisible matter, but rather **dynamic boundary layers** of the vacuum itself. At low shear rates (galactic outskirts), the vacuum undergoes a phase transition into a high-viscosity, turbulent state, providing the necessary "stiffness" to flatten rotation curves.

### 2.2. Solving the "Fine-Tuning" Problem

Standard CDM cosmology faces a significant "fine-tuning" challenge: why do Dark Matter halos distribute themselves so perfectly to produce flat rotation curves across galaxies of vastly different sizes? This is often referred to as the "conspiracy" between baryons and dark matter.

VSC resolves this naturally. The magnitude of the viscous boost is determined solely by the local baryonic shear rate.

* **In high-mass galaxies (M31):** The baryonic shear is high, so the viscosity contribution is naturally suppressed ().
* **In low-mass galaxies (M33):** The baryonic shear is low, so the viscosity contribution naturally dominates ().

The model requires no manual adjustment of "halo parameters" for individual galaxies. The fact that our global optimization recovered realistic stellar Mass-to-Light ratios () for all galaxies simultaneously serves as independent validation that the VSC mechanism is physically robust.

### 2.3. Contrast with MOND and Modified Gravity

While VSC shares phenomenological similarities with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the underlying physical trigger is fundamentally different. MOND modifies gravity based on an **acceleration threshold** (). VSC modifies gravity based on a **kinematic shear threshold** ().

This distinction is crucial for the Solar System tests. In standard MOND, regions of "saddle points" (where gravitational forces cancel out to zero acceleration) can predict anomalous behavior within the Solar System that is not observed. In contrast, VSC is driven by *shear* (the gradient of velocity). Even at a gravitational saddle point, the kinematic shear of planetary orbits remains high (), ensuring that VSC effects remain effectively "switched off" locally. This explains why VSC passes the Saturn/Cassini constraints (Figure 3) where other modified gravity theories often struggle.

### 2.4. Implications for the Dark Sector

The VSC model suggests that "Dark Matter" and "Dark Energy" may be two manifestations of the same underlying physics: vacuum viscosity.

* On **Galactic Scales**, spatial shear creates a viscosity gradient that mimics a Dark Matter halo.
* On **Cosmological Scales**, the bulk viscosity of the expanding universe mimics the negative pressure of Dark Energy (as confirmed by our  residuals in Figure 4).

By replacing two unknown entities with a single property of spacetime—fluidity—VSC offers a more parsimonious path toward a Theory of Everything.
